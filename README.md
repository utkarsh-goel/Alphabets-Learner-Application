# Alphabets-Learner-Application
I made this basic application as a part of an assignment for a course I took on Coursera 
(Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course) - Centrale Sup√©lec) 
I scored 100% marks in it. 
The Alphabets Learner Application helps kids to learn alphabets with object representations for each letter and with human pronunciation.  
All the images in the App are calibrated very precisely so that the kids can easily identify each object. 
This app not only helps them to identify objects but also help them with the pronunciations. 
The App has a very simple UI to help the nursery kids find ease and fun using it.
